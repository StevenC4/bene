Test 1

Transfer an image file (36KB) - all in slow start.  Window size grew to 35756 bytes, 
which is just over 36 packets.  Every time an ACK is received, two packets of equal size are 
sent out in its place because the window was increased.

Test 2

Transfer an image file (36KB) - all in slow start and then transfer to Additive Increment after
the window reaches 1600 bytes.  The behavior is the same as in test 1 until the window reaches 1600
bytes.  Then, it begins increasing by a fraction of an MSS per ACK received.  Two packets are sent
out in the ACKed one's place, but the first one is 1000 bytes (1 MSS) and the second on is very small
 - the fraction of an MSS by which the window was increased.
 
Test 3

Transfer an image file (145KB) - drop a single packet when the window size reaches 3200 bytes.
Small queue size, large initial threshold.  Has a multiplicative decrease, slow restart to smaller
window size.

Test 4

Burst loss - behaves about the same
